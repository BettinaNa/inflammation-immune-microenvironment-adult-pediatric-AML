## Abstract 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Here we provide a comprehensive census of the bone marrow immune microenvironment in adult and pediatric AML patients. We characterize unique inflammation signatures in a subset of AML patients, associated with inferior outcomes. We identify atypical B cells, a dysfunctional B cell subtype enriched in high-inflammation AML patients, as well as an increase in CD8+ GZMK+ and regulatory T cells, accompanied by a reduction in T cell clonal expansion. We derive an inflammation-associated gene score (iScore) that associates with poor survival outcomes in AML patients. Addition of the iScore refines current risk stratifications for AML patients and may enable identification of patients in need of more aggressive treatment. This work provides a framework for classifying AML patients based on their immune microenvironment and a rationale for consideration of the inflammatory state in clinical settings.
